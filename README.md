# Athletics Day website

This project uses **NuxtJS**. Look at the [Nuxt 3 documentation](https://nuxt.com/docs/getting-started/introduction) to learn more.

## Setup

If you are on the [Codesandbox](https://codesandbox.io/p/github/ASOwnerYT/AthleticsDay/master?import=true), it is all set up automaticially. Look at **app.vue** for the main code and **pages/index.vue** for the home page content.

Otherwise, you need to install NodeJS and Yarn, then open a terminal and run the following:

```bash
# Install dependencies
yarn install

# Run development server
yarn dev

# Build the application for production
yarn build

# Locally preview production build
yarn preview
```
